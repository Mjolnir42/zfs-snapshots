This is an example location for the RSA public key used in
the backup encryption scheme. You can generate your keypair
on your workstation like this.

First the private key:

  `openssl genrsa -des3 -out private.pem 4096`

With this, we create the public.key:

  `openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem`

And done.

Now upload your public key to the server and update
/etc/periodic.conf.local with the path and filename.
Store your private key in a secure (both in terms of access
as well as fault-tolerancy) location.

That location should neither be where you store the backups
nor the server you uploaded the public key to, obviously.
