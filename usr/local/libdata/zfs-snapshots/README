This is an example location for the RSA public key used in
the backup encryption scheme.
This is also an example keyfile. And actually not a key at
all.

You can generate your personal keypair on your workstation
like this:

First the private key:

  `openssl genrsa -aes256 -out private.pem 8192`
or
  `openssl genrsa -camellia256 -out private.pem 8192`

Basically, adjust this to your personal preferred paranoia
level.
  `openssl genrsa -h'
lists the encryption schemes supported by your version of
openssl. Length should probably not be less than 4096 nowadays,
and rarely more than somewhere in the 15360 to 16384 range.

Adjust this to your threat model and how useful the data on the
backups is for how long. The usual.

Use a proper passphrase.

With this done, we can create the public.key:

  `openssl rsa -pubout -in private.pem -out public.pem`

And done.

Now upload your public key to the server and update
/etc/periodic.conf.local with the path and filename.
Store your private key in a secure (both in terms of access
as well as fault-tolerance) location.

That location should neither be where you store the backups
nor the server you uploaded the public key to, obviously.

If you need to restore a stream you can fetch the encrypted
keyfile to your workstation, decrypt it and push it back onto
the server via a secure channel (scp, sftp).
